## 📖 Story of Orbit Smash

In a distant corner of the galaxy, countless tiny planets orbit a dying star. One by one, their fragile worlds break free, plummeting through the void toward an unknown fate.

As the appointed **Keeper of Orbits**, you alone possess the power to destroy these rogue worlds before they tear through the cosmic fabric and cause untold chaos. Each falling planet is a ticking hazard — every one you miss weakens the universe’s delicate balance.

But not all is doomed. Among the crumbling worlds are rare **Star Planets** — shimmering beacons of hope that, if caught in time, grant you cosmic energy and power.

Time is against you. The longer you hold the line, the more intense the storm becomes. But with every shattered world, you grow stronger.

## 🎮 How to Play

Simply **click on each planet** as it appears on the screen. Don’t let them get away!

- Regular Planets: Pop them before they pass the bottom, or lose health.
- Star Planets: Optional, but grant extra points if you smash them.
